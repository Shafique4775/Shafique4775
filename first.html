    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) on Monday restricted live coverage of rallies and
        public gatherings across the federal capital on March 27, hours before PTI chairman Imran Khan was expected to

        Needing 30 off the last three overs, and 22 from the last two, Najibullah Zadran and Mohammad Nabi hit a six each off pace bowler Naseem Shah in the penultimate over to reduce the target to five runs.
        Zadran then hit the winning boundary off Zaman Khan’s last over to chase down the 131-run target with one ball to spare.</p>
