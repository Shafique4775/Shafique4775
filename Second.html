    <h2>Afghanistan thump Pakistan to claim T20 series</h2>
    <!-- Usage of "b" tag and "i" -->
    <p><b> SHARJAH: Afghanistan overcame late nerves in the closing overs to beat Pakistan by seven wickets </b> in the
        second
        Twenty20 international on Sunday and take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-game series.
        <i> Needing 30 off the last three overs, and 22 from the last two, Najibullah Zadran and Mohammad Nabi hit a six
            each off pace bowler Naseem Shah in the penultimate over to reduce the target to five runs.
            Zadran then hit the winning boundary off Zaman Khan’s last over to chase down the 131-run target with one
            ball
            to spare.</i>
        “It’s a great honour and pleasure to lead this wonderful team,” said Afghanistan skipper Rashid Khan.

    <p><strong> Actors Feroze Khan and Muneeb Butt have both </strong> decided to raise a white flag and end their legal battle. Butt
        announced that he has dropped all charges against Feroze shortly after the latter explained his side and
        apologised for sharing the personal details of a number of celebrities he had taken action against for speaking
        in support of his ex-wife.
        On Sunday, <em> Feroze shared a detailed apology on Instagram. “On January 17, 2023, </em> a legal notice of defamation
        (drafted by my former legal team) was posted from my [Instagram]. Somehow, I failed to notice that the said
        notice contained the personal details of the recipients including their phone numbers. As soon as I realised, I
        deleted the post immediately within minutes,” he wrote.</p>
